	abstract = {Lecture content and practical laboratory classes are ideally complementary. However, the types of experiments that have led to our detailed understanding of sensory neuroscience are often not amenable to classroom experimentation as they require expensive equipment, time-consuming surgeries, specialized experimental techniques, and the use of animals. While sometimes feasible in small group teaching, these experiments are not suitable for large cohorts of students. Previous attempts to expose students to sensory neuroscience experiments include: the use of electrophysiology preparations in invertebrates, data-driven simulations that do not replicate the experience of conducting an experiment, or simply observing an experiment in a research laboratory. We developed an online simulation of a visual neuroscience experiment in which extracellular recordings are made from a motion sensitive neuron. Students have control over stimulation parameters (direction and contrast) and can see and hear the action potential responses to stimuli as they are presented. The simulation provides an intuitive way for students to gain insight into neurophysiology, including experimental design, data collection and data analysis. Our simulation allows large cohorts of students to cost-effectively “experience” the results of animal research without ethical concerns, to be exposed to realistic data variability, and to develop their understanding of how sensory neuroscience experiments are conducted.},

	abstract = {Machine learning approaches are increasingly used in health research. Applications range from the identification of disease onset, classification of disease severity, to predicting epileptic seizures. Although machine learning can be a powerful tool, there is potential for misuse; model performance can be inflated through overfitting and, consequently, will not generalize to the greater population. The risk of misuse increases when the number of variables extracted from continuous data is almost unlimited, as is the case for neural, movement, and acoustic (e.g., speech and music) data. Given that health research may contain small sample sizes, and outcome variables can be noisier for clinical populations, there are important points that should be considered before using machine learning. We suggest best practices in machine learning including data formatting, reducing data dimensionality, model selection and evaluation, and other steps within the machine learning process. We further discuss some common pitfalls in applying machine learning to small sample sizes and high-dimensional data (e.g., speech biomarkers, neural and imaging data). We advocate for parsimonious approaches that include selecting the simplest machine learning method that best describes the data, preventing redundancy and overfitting through variable elimination, and ensuring that certain variables or approaches do not inflate machine learning outcomes. We further consider approaches that can identify the best predictors (or combinations thereof), as well as “black box” machine learning methods (e.g., deep learning). Finally, we discuss the limitations of current machine learning methods and pose future directions to broaden the applicability of machine learning tools and ensure the outcomes are robust against random factors.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in bioinformatics and high-throughput sequencing have enabled the large-scale recovery of genomes from metagenomes. This has the potential to bring important insights as researchers can bypass cultivation and analyse genomes sourced directly from environmental samples. There are, however, technical challenges associated with this process, most notably the complexity of computational workflows required to process metagenomic data, which include dozens of bioinformatics software tools, each with their own set of customisable parameters that affect the final output of the workflow. At the core of these workflows are the processes of assembly - combining the short input reads into longer, contiguous fragments (contigs), and binning - clustering these contigs into individual genome bins. Both processes can be done for each sample separately or by pooling together multiple samples to leverage information from a combination of samples. Here we present Metaphor, a fully-automated workflow for genome-resolved metagenomics (GRM). Metaphor differs from existing GRM workflows by offering flexible approaches for the assembly and binning of the input data, and by combining multiple binning algorithms with a bin refinement step to achieve high quality genome bins. Moreover, Metaphor generates reports to evaluate the performance of the workflow. We showcase the functionality of Metaphor on different synthetic datasets, and the impact of available assembly and binning strategies on the final results. The workflow is freely available at https://github.com/vinisalazar/metaphor.
Author summary We present Metaphor, a user-friendly, automated workflow for the recovery of genomes from metagenomes. Our tool offers flexible options for assembling and binning metagenomic contigs, that may be adjusted according to the characteristics of the input data and available computational resources, and a combination of binning algorithms, which improves the quantity and quality of resulting genome bins. We showcase the performance of Metaphor on synthetic benchmarking datasets and discuss the implication of methodological decisions regarding the strategy for assembling and binning metagenomic contigs.},

	abstract = {Vietnam aims to eliminate tuberculosis (TB) by 2030 but still faces many challenges in accurately and rapidly diagnosing people with TB. Testing of presumptive cases of TB using GeneXpert, included to detect multidrug-resistant (MDR) - TB strains, is a cornerstone of the Vietnam Ministry of Health’s (MOH) strategy to eliminate TB. The GeneXpert test, which is performed by a GeneXpert machine, is a molecular test that diagnoses TB by detecting the presence of TB bacteria and tests for resistance to the drug Rifampicin. This procedure uses unprocessed sputum samples, produces results within two hours (which is substantially faster than drug susceptibility testing), and requires no additional technical equipment, which makes it especially suitable in contexts with limited laboratory capacity. The MOH’s TB program has and intends to continue to mobilize external financing, both loans and grants, from development partners (including the global fund and the World Bank) to procure a sufficient number of GeneXpert machines and cartridges to reach these goals. To ensure that resources used to purchase GeneXpert machines are put to their most efficient use, especially considering the substantial cost of this equipment, the placement of future machines should be such that it maximizes the share of the unmet need for TB testing that is addressed by the investment. Optimization of GeneXpert placement in Vietnam was previously carried out on a smaller scale, for 13 provinces, to inform the placement of 35 GeneXpert machines that will be purchased as part of a new World Bank-financed project (loan). This study extends that analysis to the national level, including all of Vietnam’s provinces. The objective of this national-level analysis is to provide guidance to the Government of Vietnam and its development partners in deciding where future GeneXpert machines should be located to best achieve Vietnam’s goal of testing all presumptive TB cases by GeneXpert.},

	abstract = {Background and aims Although most opioid-related mortality in Australia involves prescription opioids, most research to understand the impact of naloxone supply on opioid-related mortality has focused upon people who inject heroin. We aimed to examine the cost and probable impact of up-scaling naloxone supply to people who are prescribed opioids. Design Decision-tree model. Four scenarios were compared with a baseline scenario (the current status quo): naloxone scale-up between 2020 and 2030 to reach 30 or 90\% coverage by 2030, among the subgroups of people prescribed either ≥ 50 or ≥ 100 mg of oral morphine equivalents (OME). Setting Australia. Participants People who are prescribed opioids. Measurements Possible deaths averted, costs (ambulance and naloxone distribution) and cost per life saved for different scenarios of naloxone scale-up. Findings Maintaining the status quo, there would be an estimated 7478 [uncertainty interval (UI) = 6868–8275] prescription opioid overdose deaths between 2020 and 2030, resulting in Australian dollars (A{\textbackslash})51.9 million (49.4, 56.0) in ambulance costs. If naloxone were scaled-up to 90\% of people prescribed {\textgreater} 50 mg OME, an estimated 657 (UI = 245, 1489) deaths could be averted between 2020 and 2030 (a 20\% reduction in the final year of the model compared with the no naloxone scenario), with a cost of A{\textbackslash}43 600 (20 800–110 500) per life saved. If naloxone were scaled-up to 30\% of people prescribed {\textgreater} 50 mg OME an estimated 219 (82–496) deaths could be averted with the same cost per live saved. If naloxone were restricted to those prescribed {\textgreater} 100 mg OME, an estimated 130 (UI = 44–289) deaths would be averted if scaled-up to 30\% or 390 (UI = 131–866) deaths averted if scaled-up to 90\%, with the cost per life saved for both scenarios A\$38 200 (UI = 12 400–97 400). Conclusion In Australia, scaling-up take-home naloxone by 2030 to reach 90\% of people prescribed daily doses of ≥ 50 mg of oral morphine equivalents would be cost-effective and save more than 650 lives.},

	abstract = {Physiology is commonly taught through direct experience and observation of scientific phenomena in “hands-on” practical laboratory classes. The value of such classes is limited by students’ lack of understanding of the underlying theoretical concepts and their lack of confidence with the experimental techniques. In our experience, students follow experimental steps as if following a recipe, without giving thought to the underlying theory and the relationship between the experimental procedure and the research hypotheses. To address this issue, and to enhance student learning, we developed an online virtual experiment for students to complete before an inquiry-based practical. The virtual experiment and “live” practical laboratory were an investigation of how autonomic nerves control contractions in the isolated rabbit ileum. We hypothesized that the virtual experiment would support students’ understanding of the physiological concepts, as well as the experimental design associated with the practical. Anonymous survey data and usage analytics showed that most students engaged with the virtual experiment. Students thought that it helped them to understand the practical physiological concepts and experimental design, with self-reported time spent on the virtual experiment (and not on lectures or practical class notes) a significant predictor of their understanding. This novel finding provides evidence that virtual experiments can contribute to students’ research skills development. Our results indicate that self-paced online virtual experiments are an effective way to enhance student understanding of physiological concepts and experimental processes, allowing for a more realistic experience of the scientific method and a more effective use of time in practical classes.},

	abstract = {Adaptation is a multi-faceted phenomenon that is of interest in terms of both its function and its potential to reveal underlying neural processing. Many behavioral studies have shown that after exposure to an oriented adapter the perceived orientation of a subsequent test is repulsed away from the orientation of the adapter. This is the well-known Tilt Aftereffect (TAE). Recently, we showed that the dynamics of recurrently connected networks may contribute substantially to the neural changes induced by adaptation, especially on short time scales. Here we extended the network model and made the novel behavioral prediction that the TAE should be attractive, not repulsive, on a time scale of a few 100 ms. Our experiments, using a novel adaptation protocol that specifically targeted adaptation on a short time scale, confirmed this prediction. These results support our hypothesis that recurrent network dynamics may contribute to short-term adaptation. More broadly, they show that understanding the neural processing of visual inputs that change on the time scale of a typical fixation requires a detailed analysis of not only the intrinsic properties of neurons, but also the slow and complex dynamics that emerge from their recurrent connectivity. We argue that this is but one example of how even simple recurrent networks can underlie surprisingly complex information processing, and are involved in rudimentary forms of memory, spatio-temporal integration, and signal amplification.},

These areas were selected based on their identification as “hub” areas of the default mode and cortical salience networks, respectively. Microinjections of fluorescent tracers, along with gold-nanoparticle-conjugated cholera toxin B-subunit and biotinylated dextran amine, were placed in subdivisions of the anterior cingulate area 24b/c and in medial prefrontal areas 32 and 32V. The resulting distribution of transported label showed rostral-caudal and dorsal-ventral topographic arrangement of claustrum connections and clear rostral-caudal topography of insular projections. Medial prefrontal connections were restricted mainly to a ventromedial strip located in the rostral half of the claustrum, with a second, smaller patch of cells in the caudal, ventrolateral portion. In contrast, injections into area 24 yielded dense, widespread connections from the dorsal claustrum, extending along its entire rostral-caudal length. Projections from the “classical” agranular, disgranular, and granular insular areas were sparse or nonexistent in areas 32 and 32V, with progressively increasing connections observed in more caudal tracer injections (i.e., in subdivisions of area 24). Transported label was observed in rostral peri-insular areas orbital periallocortex, orbital proisocortex, and insular proisocortex following all prefrontal injections. These data provide a structural connectivity foundation for interpretation of functional imaging studies, which often indicate activity in the “anterior insula” that may arise, in part, from claustrum and/or peri-insular projections to the anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortices.

	abstract = {Orientation selectivity is a key characteristic of visual cortical neurons and it is first exhibited in primary visual cortex. This selectivity is not a static property of cortical neurons, but rather depends on the recent stimulus history. In particular, even a brief exposure to an oriented stimulus is known to result in shifts of orientation tuning curves. These shifts are typically interpreted as signs of short-term plasticity in primary visual cortex. This interpretation, however, ignores that visual cortical cells are part of a dynamical system with recurrent connections through which information on stimulus history becomes embedded in the neural response. We investigated whether these dynamics can explain the reported adaptation effects. Methods: We implemented a network model of orientation selectivity based on recurrent lateral interactions to study the temporal dynamics of orientation tuning and its dependence on stimulus history. Results: When presented with pairs of gratings, the model replicated the shifts in tuning curves that have been observed experimentally. No changes in model parameters or addition of new parameters were necessary to obtain these shifts; rather, they emerged naturally as a consequence of the network not reaching its steady state response during the rapid presentation of multiple stimuli. Conclusion: This finding has important implications for the interpretation of changes in neural responses that depend on recent history; our simulations show that such changes need not involve any plasticity and could be caused by neural population dynamics, which are slow due to the recurrent connections. These implications are not limited to the orientation tuning networks of V1 but extend to any recurrently connected neural network. Meeting abstract presented at VSS 2012},

	abstract = {Recurrent connections are known to play a role in the coding of orientation in primary visual cortex (e.g. for contrast invariance) but many questions remain regarding their precise functional role and possible byproducts. Previously, we implemented a recurrent model of orientation selectivity and tested responses to pairs of gratings presented briefly in succession (adapter and test). The model generated repulsive shifts in tuning curves that matched those found experimentally in V1. Unlike the shifts produced with long adaptation periods (thought to underlie the tilt after-effect [TAE]), which are well accounted for by plasticity, the repulsive shifts we observed were the result of slow population dynamics only. These effects on tuning curves gave rise to attractive shifts in the population response towards the adapter, suggesting that perception of the test orientation should -under such conditions- be biased towards the adapted orientation. Methods: To test this prediction, we asked human subjects to determine which of two Gabors (test and reference) presented simultaneously for a short period of time (Ͱ4;100 ms) at either side of the fixation dot was tilted more clockwise. Crucially, the test was preceded by another oriented Gabor (adapter) in the same location (Ͱ4;100 ms), while the reference was preceded by a non-oriented pattern matched for contrast and spatial frequency. Both test and reference were succeeded by non-oriented patterns to reduce afterimages. Results: The psychometric curves exhibited significant shifts consistent with an attraction of perceived orientation of the test towards the adapter. The observed effect matches the predicted effect of population dynamics, and is opposite in direction to the more commonly studied TAE. Conclusion: Population dynamics affect the coding of information and behavioral responses at fast timescales and can produce adaptation-like effects even without any form of neural plasticity.

	abstract = {As student numbers increase in biomedical science departments such as ours, teaching staff numbers and time for teaching remain mostly constant. This puts an undue pressure on staff, who have to make a difficult balance between preserving time for other activities (like research) without compromising teaching quality. In response to these pressures we have developed a suite of online interactive practical simulations, to complement and/or extend existing classes across a range of Physiology topics. All virtual labs are based on a general template with a series of tabs, namely, background theory, experimental system (the “wet lab”) that the simulation models, instructions on how to run the simulation, and data collection tabs. Information is provided through blended use of text, illustrations, videos, interactive animations, and diagrams. Data are collected and plotted online on a coordinate system and/or entered into tables and there is immediate online validation and feedback of student input. The simulations are backed up with assessments tools. The assessments can be set up so that they evaluate pre-simulation reading and students do not get access to the simulation until they have successfully completed multiple choice questions, short answer questions, or “drag-and-drop” style questions. Key concepts and proper interpretation of the data are evaluated in a similar fashion. Our online labs serve five key outcomes: Familiarizing students with the specifics of the experimental setup and data collection that they simulate. This has resulted in more efficient “wet lab” practical classes, allowing for more efficient data collection and more time to fully explore the experimental process, and engage in data analysis and interpretation. Allowing students to perform experiments that are impossible in a traditional classroom, such as the effects of aging or disease, or the effects of expensive or controlled substances. Reducing the number of animals used in the practical classes, which addresses both growing student concern into the use of animals for teaching and the time spent by staff preparing surgical procedures, tissues, etc. Bridging gaps in knowledge necessary to carry out the wet lab class, such as how to evaluate and enter data collected for analysis, or reminding the student of the anatomy or physiology of the system to be studied. Every student is fully involved in all aspects of each simulation, and we randomize the data so that no two students get identical data. This stands in contrast to the limitations introduced by the use of expensive equipment, where large student groups perform an experiment with only a few of them actively involved in the process, and no variability in the data. Student responses to these tools were very positive as reflected in student usage, anonymous comments, student ratings of the units which incorporated these tools, and student-driven teaching awards for innovation. An unexpected finding was the wide dissemination of the simulations by the students who had access to the material to students in other classes where little physiology was undertaken in practical classes. Currently the simulations average {\textgreater} 2500 hits/month from within the biomedical and medical sciences. We will be developing more such simulations and propose to make these tools widely available for use in teaching of physiology (see http://ilearn.med.monash.edu.au/physiology/).
