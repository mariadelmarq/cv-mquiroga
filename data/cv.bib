	abstract = {Lecture content and practical laboratory classes are ideally complementary. However, the types of experiments that have led to our detailed understanding of sensory neuroscience are often not amenable to classroom experimentation as they require expensive equipment, time-consuming surgeries, specialized experimental techniques, and the use of animals. While sometimes feasible in small group teaching, these experiments are not suitable for large cohorts of students. Previous attempts to expose students to sensory neuroscience experiments include: the use of electrophysiology preparations in invertebrates, data-driven simulations that do not replicate the experience of conducting an experiment, or simply observing an experiment in a research laboratory. We developed an online simulation of a visual neuroscience experiment in which extracellular recordings are made from a motion sensitive neuron. Students have control over stimulation parameters (direction and contrast) and can see and hear the action potential responses to stimuli as they are presented. The simulation provides an intuitive way for students to gain insight into neurophysiology, including experimental design, data collection and data analysis. Our simulation allows large cohorts of students to cost-effectively “experience” the results of animal research without ethical concerns, to be exposed to realistic data variability, and to develop their understanding of how sensory neuroscience experiments are conducted.},

	abstract = {Sensory adaptation is a phenomenon in which neurons are affected not only by their immediate input but also by the sequence of preceding inputs. In visual cortex, for example, neurons shift their preferred orientation after exposure to an oriented stimulus. This adaptation is traditionally attributed to plasticity. We show that a recurrent network generates tuning curve shifts observed in cat and macaque visual cortex, even when all synaptic weights and intrinsic properties in the model are ﬁxed. This demonstrates that, in a recurrent network, adaptation on timescales of hundreds of milliseconds does not require plasticity. Given the ubiquity of recurrent connections, this phenomenon likely contributes to responses observed across cortex and shows that plasticity cannot be inferred solely from changes in tuning on these timescales. More broadly, our ﬁndings show that recurrent connections can endow a network with a powerful mechanism to store and integrate recent contextual information.},

	abstract = {Physiology is commonly taught through direct experience and observation of scientific phenomena in “hands-on” practical laboratory classes. The value of such classes is limited by students’ lack of understanding of the underlying theoretical concepts and their lack of confidence with the experimental techniques. In our experience, students follow experimental steps as if following a recipe, without giving thought to the underlying theory and the relationship between the experimental procedure and the research hypotheses. To address this issue, and to enhance student learning, we developed an online virtual experiment for students to complete before an inquiry-based practical. The virtual experiment and “live” practical laboratory were an investigation of how autonomic nerves control contractions in the isolated rabbit ileum. We hypothesized that the virtual experiment would support students’ understanding of the physiological concepts, as well as the experimental design associated with the practical. Anonymous survey data and usage analytics showed that most students engaged with the virtual experiment. Students thought that it helped them to understand the practical physiological concepts and experimental design, with self-reported time spent on the virtual experiment (and not on lectures or practical class notes) a significant predictor of their understanding. This novel finding provides evidence that virtual experiments can contribute to students’ research skills development. Our results indicate that self-paced online virtual experiments are an effective way to enhance student understanding of physiological concepts and experimental processes, allowing for a more realistic experience of the scientific method and a more effective use of time in practical classes.},

	abstract = {Background and aims: Although most opioid-related mortality in Australia involves prescription opioids, most research to understand the impact of naloxone supply on opioidrelated mortality has focused upon people who inject heroin. We aimed to examine the cost and probable impact of up-scaling naloxone supply to people who are prescribed opioids. Design: Decision-tree model. Four scenarios were compared with a baseline scenario (the current status quo): naloxone scale-up between 2020 and 2030 to reach 30 or 90\% coverage by 2030, among the subgroups of people prescribed either ≥ 50 or ≥ 100 mg of oral morphine equivalents (OME). Setting: Australia. Participants: People who are prescribed opioids.
Measurements: Possible deaths averted, costs (ambulance and naloxone distribution) and cost per life saved for different scenarios of naloxone scale-up. Findings: Maintaining the status quo, there would be an estimated 7478 [uncertainty interval (UI) = 6868–8275] prescription opioid overdose deaths between 2020 and 2030, resulting in Australian dollars (A\$)51.9 million (49.4, 56.0) in ambulance costs. If naloxone were scaled-up to 90\% of people prescribed {\textgreater} 50 mg OME, an estimated 657 (UI = 245, 1489) deaths could be averted between 2020 and 2030 (a 20\% reduction in the final year of the model compared with the no naloxone scenario), with a cost of A \$43 600 (20 800–110 500) per life saved. If naloxone were scaled-up to 30\% of people prescribed {\textgreater} 50 mg OME an estimated 219 (82–496) deaths could be averted with the same cost per live saved. If naloxone were restricted to those prescribed {\textgreater} 100 mg OME, an estimated 130 (UI = 44–289) deaths would be averted if scaled-up to 30\% or 390 (UI = 131–866) deaths averted if scaled-up to 90\%, with the cost per life saved for both scenarios A\$38 200 (UI = 12 400–97 400).
Conclusion: In Australia, scaling-up take-home naloxone by 2030 to reach 90\% of people prescribed daily doses of ≥ 50 mg of oral morphine equivalents would be cost-effective and save more than 650 lives.},

The campaign simply employs synchronous, duplicate posts by ostensibly distinct authors to ensure that a significant proportion of posts mentioning contentious special autonomy arrangements are pro-government. Despite lacking sophistication, the scale of this information campaign in overall Twitter discussion of special autonomy adds to concerns about the ability of pro-government actors to employ disinformation to constrict political discourse in Southeast Asia.},

	abstract = {Vietnam aims to eliminate tuberculosis (TB) by 2030 but still faces many challenges in accurately and rapidly diagnosing people with TB. Testing of presumptive cases of TB using GeneXpert, included to detect multidrug-resistant (MDR) - TB strains, is a cornerstone of the Vietnam Ministry of Health’s (MOH) strategy to eliminate TB. The GeneXpert test, which is performed by a GeneXpert machine, is a molecular test that diagnoses TB by detecting the presence of TB bacteria and tests for resistance to the drug Rifampicin. This procedure uses unprocessed sputum samples, produces results within two hours (which is substantially faster than drug susceptibility testing), and requires no additional technical equipment, which makes it especially suitable in contexts with limited laboratory capacity. The MOH’s TB program has and intends to continue to mobilize external financing, both loans and grants, from development partners (including the global fund and the World Bank) to procure a sufficient number of GeneXpert machines and cartridges to reach these goals. To ensure that resources used to purchase GeneXpert machines are put to their most efficient use, especially considering the substantial cost of this equipment, the placement of future machines should be such that it maximizes the share of the unmet need for TB testing that is addressed by the investment. Optimization of GeneXpert placement in Vietnam was previously carried out on a smaller scale, for 13 provinces, to inform the placement of 35 GeneXpert machines that will be purchased as part of a new World Bank-financed project (loan). This study extends that analysis to the national level, including all of Vietnam’s provinces. The objective of this national-level analysis is to provide guidance to the Government of Vietnam and its development partners in deciding where future GeneXpert machines should be located to best achieve Vietnam’s goal of testing all presumptive TB cases by GeneXpert.},
