	abstract = {Background and aims Major declines in HIV and hepatitis C and B virus (HCV/HBV) incidence among people who inject drugs (PWID) have been attributed to early implementation of harm-reduction programs (HRP) in the Netherlands, but alternative factors such as selective mortality and demographic and drug market shifts over time probably contributed to observed incidence declines. We quantified and tested the effect of HRP participation on risk of these infections among PWID in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Design We emulated the design of a hypothetical, ideal randomized trial using observational data from the Amsterdam Cohort Studies (1985–2014). Setting Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Participants We included PWID who ever used opioids, had a recent history of injecting drug use (IDU) and tested negative for HIV, HCV or HBV. Of 983 participants, 640, 137 and 308 were included for the HIV, HCV and HBV analyses and 59, 45 and 49 seroconversions were observed, respectively. Interventions Intervention arms were: complete HRP participation [≥ 60 mg/day methadone and 100\% needle and syringe program (NSP) coverage, or any methadone dose if no recent injection drug use] versus no HRP and partial HRP participation combined ({\textless} 60 methadone mg/day and/or {\textless} 100\% NSP coverage). Conclusions Complete participation in harm reduction programs appears to have led to substantial decreases in HIV and hepatitis C and B virus acquisition risk among people who inject drugs in the Netherlands. Measurements Separately for each infection, we estimated the hazard ratios (HR) comparing HRP arms using marginal structural models. Findings Compared with no/partial HRP participation, complete HRP participation led to lower risk of HIV [HR = 0.54, 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 0.27–1.08], HCV (HR = 0.16, 95\% CI = 0.06–0.40) and HBV (HR = 0.28, 95\% CI = 0.13–0.61) acquisition.},

	abstract = {Introduction Botswana offers publicly financed HIV treatment to citizens, but not migrants, who comprised about 7\% of the population in 2016. However, HIV incidence is not declining in proportion to Botswana’s HIV response. In 2018, Botswana had 86\% of citizens living with HIV diagnosed, 95\% of people diagnosed on treatment, and 95\% viral suppression among those on treatment. We hypothesised that continued exclusion of migrants is hampering reduction of HIV incidence in Botswana. Hence, we modelled the impact of including migrants in Botswana’s HIV response on achieving 90-90-90 and 95-95-95 Fast-Track targets by 2020 and 2030, respectively. Methods The Optima HIV model, with demographic, epidemiological, and behavioural inputs, was applied to citizens of and migrants to Botswana. Projections of new HIV infections and HIV-related deaths were compared for three scenarios to the end of 2030: (1) continued status quo for HIV testing and treatment coverage, and maintenance of levels of linkage to care, loss to follow-up, and viral suppression among citizens and migrants (baseline); (2) with scaled-up budget, optimised to achieve 90-90-90 and 95-95-95 Fast-Track targets by 2020 and 2030, respectively, for citizens only; and (3) scaled-up optimised budget to achieve these targets for both citizens and migrants. Results A baseline of 172,000 new HIV infections and 8,400 HIV-related deaths was projected over 2020–2030. Scaling up to achieve targets among citizens only averted an estimated 48,000 infections and 1,700 deaths. Achieving targets for both citizens and migrants averted 16,000 (34\%) more infections and 442 (26\%) more deaths. Scaling up for both populations reduced numbers of new HIV infections and deaths by 44\% and 39\% respectively compared with 2010 levels. Treating migrants when scaling up in both populations was estimated to cost USD 74 million over 2020–2030. Conclusions Providing HIV services to migrants in Botswana could lead to further reductions in HIV incidence and deaths. However, even with an increased, optimised budget that achieves 95-95-95 targets for both citizens and migrants by 2030, the 90\% incidence reduction target for 2020 will be missed. Further efficiencies and innovations will be needed to meet HIV targets in Botswana.},

	abstract = {Auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) have been used to understand how the brain processes auditory input, and to track developmental change in sensory systems. Localizing ERP generators can provide invaluable insights into how and where auditory information is processed. However, age-appropriate infant brain templates have not been available to aid such developmental mapping. In this study, auditory change detection responses of brain ERPs were examined in 6-month-old infants using discrete and distributed source localization methods mapped onto age-appropriate magnetic resonance images. Infants received a passive oddball paradigm using fast-rate non-linguistic auditory stimuli (tone doublets) with the deviant incorporating a pitch change for the second tone. Data was processed using two different high-pass filters. When a 0.5Hz filter was used, the response to the pitch change was a large frontocentral positive component. When a 3Hz filter was applied, two temporally consecutive components associated with change detection were seen: one with negative voltage, and another with positive voltage over frontocentral areas. Both components were localized close to the auditory cortex with an additional source near to the anterior cingulate cortex. The sources for the negative response had a more tangential orientation relative to the supratemporal plane compared to the positive response, which showed a more lateral, oblique orientation. The results described here suggest that at 6months of age infants generate similar response patterns and use analogous cortical areas to that of adults to detect changes in the auditory environment. Moreover, the source locations and orientations, together with waveform topography and morphology provide evidence in infants for feature-specific change detection followed by involuntary switching of attention.},

	abstract = {Introduction In 2014, the Government of Thailand recommended pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) as an additional HIV prevention programme within Thailand's National Guidelines on HIV/AIDS Treatment Prevention. However, to date implementation and uptake of PrEP programmes have been limited, and evidence on the costs and the epidemiological and economic impact is not available. Methods We estimated the costs associated with PrEP provision among men having sex with men (MSM) participating in a facility-based, prospective observational cohort study: the Test, Treat and Prevent HIV Programme in Thailand. We created a suite of scenarios to estimate the cost-effectiveness of PrEP and sensitivity of the results to the model input parameters, including PrEP programme effectiveness, PrEP uptake among high-risk and low-risk MSM, baseline and future antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage, condom use, unit cost of delivering PrEP, and the discount rate. Results Drug costs accounted for 82.5\% of the total cost of providing PrEP, followed by lab testing (8.2\%) and personnel costs (7.8\%). The estimated costs of providing the PrEP package in accordance with the national recommendation ranges from US{\textbackslash}223 to US{\textbackslash}311 per person per year. Based on our modelling results, we estimate that PrEP would be cost-effective when provided to either high-risk or all MSM. However, we found that the programme would be approximately 32\% more cost-effective if offered to high-risk MSM than it would be if offered to all MSM, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US{\textbackslash}4,836 per disability-adjusted life years (DALY) averted and US{\textbackslash}7,089 per DALY averted respectively. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves demonstrate that 80\% of scenarios would be cost-effective when PrEP is provided solely to higher-risk MSM. Conclusion We provide the first estimates on cost and cost-effectiveness of PrEP in the Asia-Pacific region, and offer insights on how to deliver PrEP in combination with ART. While the high drug cost poses a budgeting challenge, incorporating PrEP delivery into an existing ART programme could be a cost-effective strategy to prevent HIV infections among MSM in Thailand.},

	abstract = {Event-related potentials (ERPs) have become an important tool in the quest to understand how infants process perceptual information. Identification of the activation loci of the ERP generators is a technique that provides an opportunity to explore the neural substrates that underlie auditory processing. Nevertheless, as infant brain templates from healthy, non-clinical samples have not been available, the majority of source localization studies in infants have used non-realistic head models, or brain templates derived from older children or adults. Given the dramatic structural changes seen across infancy, all of which profoundly affect the electrical fields measured with EEG, it is important to use individual MRIs or age-appropriate brain templates and parameters to explore the localization and time course of auditory ERP sources. In this study 6-month-old infants were presented with a passive oddball paradigm using consonant–vowel (CV) syllables that differed in voice onset time. Dense-array EEG/ERPs were collected while the infants were awake and alert. In addition, MRIs were acquired during natural non-sedated sleep for a subset of the sample. Discrete dipole and distributed source models were mapped onto individual and averaged infant MRIs. The CV syllables elicited a positive deflection at about 200ms followed by a negative deflection that peaked around 400ms. The source models generated placed the dipoles at temporal areas close to auditory cortex for both positive and negative responses. Notably, an additional dipole for the positive peak was localized at the frontal area, at the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) level. ACC activation has been reported in adults, but has not, to date, been reported in infants during processing of speech-related signals. The frontal ACC activation was earlier but smaller in amplitude than the left and right auditory temporal activations. These results demonstrate that in infancy the ERP generators to CV syllables are localized in cortical areas similar to that reported in adults, but exhibit a notably different temporal course. Specifically, ACC activation in infants significantly precedes auditory temporal activation, whereas in adults ACC activation follows that of temporal cortex. We suggest that these timing differences could be related to current maturational changes, to the ongoing construction of language-specific phonetic maps, and/or to more sensitive attentional switching as a response to speech signals in infancy.},

	abstract = {Humans and other primates rely on eye movements to explore visual scenes and to track moving objects. As a result, the image that is projected onto the retina-and propagated throughout the visual cortical hierarchy-is almost constantly changing and makes little sense without taking into account the momentary direction of gaze. How is this achieved in the visual system? Here, we show that in primary visual cortex (V1), the earliest stage of cortical vision, neural representations carry an embedded "eye tracker" that signals the direction of gaze associated with each image. Using chronically implanted multi-electrode arrays, we recorded the activity of neurons in area V1 of macaque monkeys during tasks requiring fast (exploratory) and slow (pursuit) eye movements. Neurons were stimulated with flickering, full-field luminance noise at all times. As in previous studies, we observed neurons that were sensitive to gaze direction during fixation, despite comparable stimulation of their receptive fields. We trained a decoder to translate neural activity into metric estimates of gaze direction. This decoded signal tracked the eye accurately not only during fixation but also during fast and slow eye movements. After a fast eye movement, the eye-position signal arrived in V1 at approximately the same time at which the new visual information arrived from the retina. Using simulations, we show that this V1 eye-position signal could be used to take into account the sensory consequences of eye movements and map the fleeting positions of objects on the retina onto their stable position in the world.},
